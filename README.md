# Elysia Client

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application, designed to test ElysiaJS API endpoints.

## Purpose

This client is meant to verify and test an ElysiaJS server by inputting the server's domain/IP address, optional port and api version number, and an Auth method if preferred.
